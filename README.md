# Kickstart-My-Chart

## Background

Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the over 300,000 projects aunched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. 

Organized and analyzed a database of four thousand past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

## Report - StarterBook Project
## 1.	What are three conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data?
a)	From Pivot Chart 1, its obvious that most successful Kickstarter campaigns fall under the category theater followed by music and film & video for all the countries. Comparing country wise the number of successful projects under category theater and music is almost same for United States, whereas for Canada, its more for theater category. This reflects that theater is the most popular category. 
Looking at the Pivot Chart 2, it can be concluded that subcategory plays which falls under theater category, has most of the successful projects.

b)	All the projects under journalism category got canceled. Although, the goals for some of the projects were quite high, but the percentage of funding was almost zero, making it a non-popular category.

c)	There is a decline in the success rate for all the campaigns from the from May till September and after that it starts increasing and is almost constant for the month of October and November.Looking at the chart for Goal vs percentage of outcome, we can conclude that the most successful Kickstarter Campaigns had a goal of up to 10,000. 


## 2.	What are some of the limitations of this dataset?
a)	The one limitation, I see with this dataset is that the currency. For conducting Apple-to-Apple comparison, one should first use the currency conversion.

b)	This dataset includes all diverse types of categories and sub-categories. Instead of focusing on various categories & sub-categories, like film & video, technology, etc., if we focus on only few related categories, the analysis would be more easy and meaningful.


## 3.	What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?
Other possible tables and charts which could be created are to find the relationship between goal amount and the pledged amount and their outcome rate.
There are many projects which have a goal of only $1 and they were funded like anything. The most surprising thing is that most of them were successful.
